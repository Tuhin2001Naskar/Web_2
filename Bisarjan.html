	Durga Puja ends with Visarjan.<br>
	West Bengal's biggest festival Durga Puja may have ended but the celebratory mood is still on as the city gears up for the second edition of the immersion carnival to be held here on Tuesday, showcasing the award-winning Durga idols of this year.<br>
	The carnival, a state government-organised road show, will be held at the iconic Indira Gandhi Sarani (erstwhile Red Road), where the idols and replica of marquees of around 65 most popular community puja committees from the city and the adjoining areas will be on view as part of the immersion procession.</p>
