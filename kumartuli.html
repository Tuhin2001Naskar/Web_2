	If you've marveled over the intricate beauty of the idols of Goddess Durga during the Durga Puja festival in Kolkata, you've no doubt wondered how they're made. It's actually possible to see the idols being handcrafted. Where? Kumartuli Potter's Town in north Kolkata.<br>
	The settlement of Kumartuli, meaning "potter locality" (Kumar = potter. Tuli = locality), is over 300 years old. It was formed by a bunch of potters who came to the area in search of a better livelihood. Nowadays, around 150 families live there, earning a living by sculpting idols for the various festivals.<br>
	In the lead up to Durga Puja, thousands of artisans (many who are hired from other areas) toil diligently in about 550 workshops to complete the statues of Durga and her four children (Ganesh, Lakshmi, Kartikeya, and Saraswati) in time for the festival. What's pleasing to note is that the idols are made out of environmentally friendly materials such as bamboo and clay. This differs from the idols of Lord Ganesh, which are predominantly made out of Plaster of Paris for the Ganesh Chaturthi festival, particularly in Mumbai.<br>
	Most of the clay is brought by boat down the Hooghly River from a nearby village. What's particularly interesting is the ritual tradition of obtaining soil from a brothel and mixing it with the clay. It's considered to be punya maati (blessed soil) collected from a nishiddho palli (forbidden territory). Apparently, according to one belief, when a man visits a brothel he leaves his purity outside and it settles into the soil there. Others say that the soil is used to respect the purity of the prostitutes' souls, despite the profession they are engaged in.<br>
	However, this conflicts with the fact that the sex workers aren't even permitted at some Durga Puja celebrations.<br>
	The artisans start by making a bamboo frame for the idol, called a kathamo. They bind straw over it to give it structure, and then apply clay on top to give it its final shape. After drying the statue in the sun for a few days, they paint and decorate it. The drying process can be a problem though because the work takes place during the monsoon season, when the weather is damp and wet.<br>
	Authentic classic idols are decorated with daaker saaj, a type of silver foil. These days, many idols are given a contemporary look though. They're crafted by lesser-known artisans, who are experimental in nature. However, there are a few renowned names associated with traditional idols that inspire deep devotion. One such person was the late Ramesh Chandra Pal. His sons have taken over his work at Shilpa Kendra, the studio he established at 1 Kumartuli Street. The oldest idol maker, Samir Pal, is almost 75 and quite famous too.</p>
