		<p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 90px; font-size: 22px;">Durga Puja is one of the important Hindu festivals in India. The festival celebrates life, culture, traditions and customs. The festival is celebrated all over India and has different rituals and festivities especially in the eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Tripura. It is also celebrated in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir, Karnataka and Kerala. The festival is commemorated by worshipping Goddess Durga. She is worshipped for killing Mahisasur, a powerful demon who was also known as the Buffalo Demon. It also marks her return every year in the Bengali month of Aswin, remembering Lord Ram as he summoned Goddess Durga for her blessings in order to save Sita from the clutches of Ravana.<br>
		Durga Puja is one of the biggest festivals in Bengal and it is the most important socio-cultural event in the Bengali society.<br>
		The legend behind the Durga Puja festival is that Mahishasur, the Buffalo Demon, received blessings from Lord Brahma, through years of praying, which made him invincible. Once gaining this power he started destroying the world, killing people and tried to kill the Gods too. In dismay, the Gods combined their powers to create a maiden, and each placed each of their most powerful weapons in one of her ten hands. Riding a lion she killed the demon.<br>
		Durga Puja celebrations are also called as Akalbodhon. It is called so because Lord Ram wanted the blessings of Goddess Durga to save his wife Sita from Ravana's clutches. Pleased with Ram's devotion, Goddess Durga appeared before Ram and gave her blessings. Since Ram summoned the Goddess during autumn it is thus known as 'Akalbodhon'. Other legends say that Lord Shiva allowed Goddess Durga to visit her mother only for nine days in a year. Therefore this festival marks her visit to her mother's place.</p>
